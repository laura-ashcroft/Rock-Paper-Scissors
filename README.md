The classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in C++

###This game demonstrates:

- Assigning variables as strings to easily reuse certain words/phrases - reducing repetition across the code

- Breaking code down into small, specific functions to clean up the file

- Using std::cout and std::cin to create a dynamic game where the player can input their choices and receive messages

- Using a switch statement to set conditions for specific cases dependent on what the player has entered into the game

- Using a for loop to generate a random number for the computer between 1 and 3 and assign them to 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'

- Creating a series of if/else if statements to determine if the game has been won, lost or drawn

- Increasing an integer variable by 1 each time a certain condition is met

- Displaying the games played, won, lost, drawn and the game score at the end of each round

- Creating a loop where the player decides if they want to continue or end the game

## How to use
